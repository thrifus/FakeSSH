It's the result of literally minutes of work.\r\n\r\nMove your real SSH server to a different port, then run the FakeSSH server.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nIn a sense, FakeSSH is based on the idea that security through obscurity is kind of like adding a single bit to your security, the value of which is widely known. It might actually prevent a targeted attack by an unskilled attacker.\r\n\r\nMostly, though, I just like the idea that someone is wasting time trying to log into a server which will literally never let them in.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* python\r\n* paramiko\r\n\r\n# Use\r\n\r\n1. Create an RSA key using `ssh_keygen`. Save it to data/rsa.\r\n1. Copy data/config.sample.json to data/config.json\r\n1. Edit if desired.\r\n1. Run `server.py` with python.\r\n\r\nIf you're on Ubuntu, you could create an upstart script at `/etc/init/fakessh.conf`:\r\n\r\n    # fakessh\r\n    description \"A fake SSH server\"\r\n    author \"Tyler Menezes <tylermenezes@gmail.com>\"\r\n    start on runlevel [2345]\r\n    stop on runlevel [016]\r\n    respawn\r\n    exec python /opt/fakessh/server.py\r\n\r\n## Graphing\r\n\r\nIf you enable logging, you can run `python stats.py` to get statistics about login attempts. `--today` will get you the count today, and `--hist` will produce a graph of the last week. (You can use them both together.)\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edits\"></div>\r\n# Edited by [thrifus](http://thrifus.co/)\r\nEdits are clearly marked in everything modified, and those modifications are all that I should receive credit for. Everything else is [Tyler Menezes](https://github.com/tylermenezes).\r\n* Why did I edit this?\r\n    * I wanted to make it a little easier to launch\r\n    * I wanted to be able to background it and then kill it without killing all Python processes\r\n* How to install:\r\n    * I recommend placing the FakeSSH folder in your Applications folder (if on OS X, default path is set to /Applications/FakeSSH/), otherwise you'll need to edit the `FSSH` file before linking it\r\n    * `sudo ln -s /path/to/FSSH /usr/bin/FSSH`\r\n    * `sudo ln -s /path/to/KFSSH /usr/bin/KFSSH`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
